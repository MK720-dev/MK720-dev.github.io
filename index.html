                    <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in the Mediterranean, in Tunisia—a country shaped by ancient
                        civilizations, scientific heritage, and a deep cultural respect for learning. Academics
                        were always central in my life. After ranking among the top students nationally in both
                        the elementary and middle school national exams, I earned admission into two of the most
                        selective public institutions in the country: the <strong>Collège Pilote les Berges du Lac 2</strong>
                        for middle school and the <strong>Pioneer School of Ariana (LPA)</strong> for high school,
                        where I completed the mathematics section. These formative years instilled in me discipline,
                        curiosity, and a strong foundation in analytical thinking—values that continue to guide my
                        work in machine learning and research today.

                    <h3>Sports & Personal Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        Athletics have always played a central role in my life, especially <strong>judo</strong>.
                        Training taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of technical precision —
                        qualities that translate directly into my work in machine learning and computational
                        modeling. I’m also deeply interested in <strong>ancient history</strong>, particularly
                        Carthage and its scientific, military, and cultural legacy. This duality between
                        physical discipline and historical curiosity shapes both how I learn and what I build.

                    <h3>Research Interests & Aspirations</h3>
                    <p>
                        My research interests lie in <strong>robust machine learning</strong> and
                        <strong>optimization</strong>, with a focus on understanding how learning systems behave
                        in real-world, high-stakes settings. I am particularly interested in bridging the
                        persistent gap between <strong>ML theory</strong>—optimization dynamics, stability, generalization—
                        and the <strong>practical deployment</strong> of models in domains where reliability matters,
                        such as healthcare, rehabilitation, and scientific computing. Long-term, I aim to pursue
                        a PhD and work toward developing learning systems that are not only accurate, but
                        <strong>stable, interpretable, and robust under real-world conditions</strong>.
